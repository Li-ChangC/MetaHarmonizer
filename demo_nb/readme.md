# Demos and Utilities

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for demonstrating and testing the **Ontology Mapper** and **Schema Mapper** workflows, as well as utility scripts for data alignment checks.

## ðŸ“‚ Deprecated Demos
These notebooks were used in earlier experiments and are kept for reference only. They are **no longer maintained**.

- **demo_OM_2_stage.ipynb** â€“ Early two-stage Ontology Mapper prototype.
- **experiments_for_OM_small_corpus.ipynb** â€“ Ontology Mapper experiments on a small corpus.
- **schema_map_demo.ipynb** â€“ Initial demonstration of the Schema Mapper.
- **schema_mapping_evaluation.ipynb** â€“ Early evaluation scripts for Schema Mapper performance.

## ðŸ“‚ Current Useful Demo
- **ontology_mapper_workflow.ipynb** â€“ The main, up-to-date demonstration of the Ontology Mapper workflow.  
  This notebook showcases the current recommended approach for ontology mapping, including preprocessing, mapping, and evaluation.

## ðŸ“‚ Utilities
- **query_term_normalization.ipynb** â€“  
  Checks for alignment issues between **query data** and **corpus data**.  
  Misalignments may affect the accuracy evaluation, so running this notebook before large-scale evaluation is recommended.
