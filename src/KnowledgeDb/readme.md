## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- **Development Status:**  
  - Vector database integration is functional.  
  - FAISS indexes and SQLite database are provided for immediate use.  
  - Database clients are ready for NCI and UMLS queries.  
  - Knowledge DB of bio-clinical metadata is planned.

- This folder acts as the **backend vector store** for mapping workflows and retrieval-augmented generation.
